<h1>ROLES OF POLICE IN SOUTH AFRICA</h1>
<img src="image.html/download.jpg">

<p>In Trevor Noah's Born a crime, the book is set in South Africa when apartheid was still rampant. The oppresive policy was ofcourse drawn by the governmet. The government though powerful relies on the police to reinforce the laws at ground level.</p>

<p>Since South Africa was made of mixed races and the government wanted to keep people in check, laws were enacted to separate the different races.</p>

<p>Trevor says that he was born of a crime. This is because there was a law prohibiting sexual relations between whites and blacks and his mother decided to ignore that law like she did many others.Apparently, if caught having such relations one was given five years in prison.For this absurd rule, the government had appointed the best police officers whose only job was to go peeking in other peoples windows lest a white and a black were tempted to viloate the law.</p>

<p>During<a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid"> Apartheid</a> everyone hated everyone because of faults that weren't even theirs. This is because the government with the help of the police created boundaries between the different races. one way they did this was by giving different races priveleges over others. Trevor gives an example of the chinese and japanese who were labeled black and white respectively. Since they both look alike, the police would confuse them. Incase they were rediculing a japanese who they thought was chinese they would supposedly appologize for being racist</p>

<p>Apartheid was designed to keep black people under control. Since knowledge is freedom, they came up with rules that only allowed the blacks to go to bantu schools that taught nothing of much value.</p>

<p>Police were also huge contributers to corruption. Instances where Trevor was arrested, he was always asked to pay a bribe in very descreet terms.</p>

<p>The police also neglected their duties which at times caused severe repercussions. In Patricia's case, when she tried reporting that Abel had hit her, they dismissed her in saying that it was a family issue and seemed to take Abel's side. It seems the police also beat their wives. Their continued ignoring of Patricia's pleas contributed partially to her being shot in the head and Abel not paying for his crime.</p>

<p>The police helped arrest lawbreakers like Trevor, shoplifters and those accused of witchcraft. When Trevor was caught shopliffting, the police followed up the case until they questioned Trevor in school with the video footage.But since their minds were clouded with racism they couldn't see that the culprit was starring at them.</p>

<p>When Robert opened a very succesful restaurant where all races were welcomed and interacted peacefully, the authorities forced him to close up.When they failed to get him on cleanliness they forced him to have separate toilets for races for some weird reason. Robert eventually gave up and closeed down.</p>

<p> As i see it, the police did more harm than good. This is expected as they worked under the apartheid regime, that for all it was worth, which is not much, only went against basic human emotions and law.</p>

<h2>POLICE IN KENYA</h2>


<p>Although the police in kenya don't arrest people for practicing witchcraft and don't opprese the citizens to points of being called the world's largest oppresive policy, they still have their flaws.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Kenya is known for being one of the most corrupt countries.Another main source of police revenue is the amount of bribes they collect.</p>

<p>Kenya police don't ignore cases if domestic violence, probably because there is a large number of women in the force.</p>

<p>The Kenya police also stop crime in bulk everyday by arresting wrongdoers and ensuring that laws are adhered to.</p>
