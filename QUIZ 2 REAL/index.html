<h1>TREATMENT AND ROLE OF WOMEN IN HOMEGOING</h1>


<P>In Yaa Gyasi's Homegoing, we see many women who live under different conditions. Under these conditions the women face different ways of living in their treatment and roles as women.</P>

<p>In the first chapter we are introduced to Effia. Effia's and Baaba's relationship is not a healthy one. It is clear that for some unknown reason, Baaba doesn't love Effia.In such a household violence is unavvoidable. Baaba beats Effia, Cobbe beats Baaba. The author even says that for every scar that Effia had, Baaba also had one.</p>

<p>During those times, women had no right to choose who they would marry as the decision was made by their parents. Cobbe had arranged a marriage for Effia with chief Abeeku. Although Effia seems to embrace the idea, i can't help but think that perharps if she had made her own choice, she would have chosen someone who would have loved her unconditionally and not have believed the rumours that she was cursed. Baaba seems to take advantage of the role of appointing a husband to her daughter and tells Effia not to tell anyone when her blood comes. She does this because she is waiting for the highest bidder to come alone so she can get rich. In this way, girls are being used for wealth through brideprice.</p>

<p>Basing on the fact that chief Abeeku lets Effia go since she is supposedly cursed and can't have her blood meaning she can't bear children. It is clear that women are considered as child bearing machines. If you can't bear a child, your worth as a wife is greatly reduced as that is your major role.</p>


<p>During those times slavery was the in thing. It was a way of livlihood. Abronama, Esi's maid is captured and enslaved. She is punished for the littlest things such as spilling mere drops of water. Following an unfortunate series of events, Esi finds herself enslaved and at the castle where living conditions are degrading.</p>

<p>Due to high numbers of slaves, they are stacked on top of others like sacks of potatoes. Those on top deficate and urinate on those below. It is so bad that at one time the waste was all the way up their ankles.</p>

<p>The enslaved women are also raped.Esi was raped by a white man and after, she would always fear a white smile.The irony is tat the man who raped her felt disguted by her, as if it were her fault. The men knoe that those conditions are awful, so much so that they themselves get traumatized. At such times they force their ' wenches' to sleep with them without washing off the filth.</p>

<p> Since the white men are very religious and would never do anything against their bible they came up with ways to cheat their god. Since they were already married back home and it was not allowed to have more than one wife under their religion. They decide to call their black wives wenches. I would imagine that that name was offensive to the women because they considered themselves as the real wives.</p>

<p>Also, in the first two chapters, there isn't a single instance that women have been given roles of leadership. They only stay at home and take care of the family.</p>


<h2>WOMEN'S ROLE AND TREATMENT TODAY</h2>S

<p>Nowadays women have the right to choose their own husbands. There are countless childless marriages, because people discovered there are many reasons to marry besides children. Also barren couples could always adopt children. After a long struggle slavery was finally abolished. Issues such as rape and domestic violence are still prevailing because some mn refuse to get in touch with their conscience. But once they do that like many others, such traumatizing issues will only be stories.</p>

<p>Today, women can take up leadership roles, not only at home but country wide</p>
